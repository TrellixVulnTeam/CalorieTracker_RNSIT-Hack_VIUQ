For some people, keeping track of food and calorie intake can be helpful for promoting weight loss.

Research shows that people who log calories lose more weight and are more likely to keep the weight off in the long run.

CalFit tracks your weight and calculates a recommended daily calorie intake. It also has a well-designed food diary and an exercise log.
